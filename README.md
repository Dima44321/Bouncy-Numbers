# Bouncy-Numbers
Bouncy numbers are numbers not in acceding or descending order. 93158, for instance, is a bouncy number while 11579 and 97553 are not. The program asks for a proportion of bouncy numbers as an input and returns the number for which this proportion is true. For example, if you input 50%, it would return 538 because half of the numbers below 538 are bouncy.
